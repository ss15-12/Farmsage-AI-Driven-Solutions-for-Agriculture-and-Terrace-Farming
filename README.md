# Farmsage-AI-Driven-Solutions-for-Agriculture-and-Terrace-Farming
Farmsage is an advanced deep learning application that revolutionizes both conventional agricultural practices and urban terrace farming. The project encompasses four distinct models, each addressing a pivotal aspect of farming. 

->The first model, a crop selection facilitator, utilizes soil parameters to guide the choice of the most suitable crop for cultivation.

->The second model, a fertilizer guidance system, employs both crop and soil parameters to suggest appropriate fertilizers. 

->The third model is a disease identification system that detects plant diseases, enabling timely intervention. 

->The fourth model is a terrace farming advisory system, which provides guidance on the optimal soil type and contents for vegetable growth, making it particularly useful for urban dwellers interested in terrace farming. The crop selection facilitator employs a deep Sequential neural network. Similar in construction to the crop selection facilitator, the fertilizer guidance system also has a learning rate scheduler and a bigger network. The advisory models for terrace farming and disease identification considerably extend Farmsageâ€™'s capabilities. 

Through their individual features, these models add to a wide range of instruments aimed at improving agricultural methods and facilitating urban terrace farming.Farmsagerepresents a significant advancement in the application of deep learning to agriculture and urban farming. By providing a suite of decision facilitation tools, it empowers both farmers and urban dwellers to make data-driven decisions, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity in both rural and urban settings.
